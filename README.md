## Feedback

- mobx was a bit of a learning curve for me, it took me a while to understand that setter actions were needed inside of the store to be able to manipulate the state separating the application state from the view components, and how computeds worked. Overcome this by comparing it to how redux works and reading through the mobx documentation more in depth.
Reading the docs allowed me to figure out that computed values are only used to derive information from the existing state observables.
